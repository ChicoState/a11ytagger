        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            a11ytagger is a Django-based web application designed to make PDF documents more accessible 
            to everyone. We believe that digital content should be accessible to all users, regardless 
            of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            Our tool helps users add proper accessibility tags to PDF documents, ensuring that screen 
            readers and other assistive technologies can properly interpret and present the content. 
            By automating and simplifying the accessibility tagging process, we're making it easier 
            for content creators to produce inclusive, accessible documents.
