# Feature Specification: PDF Accessibility Information Extraction & Display

**Feature Branch**: `001-one-of-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "One of the first features we want to add is the ability for users to see existing a11y tags or information in the PDF. Unfortunately, pikepdf does not have OOTB support for this, so we'll need to build it ourselves. Our first feature should be an MVP library for extracting a11y information in a PDF, and displaying that information to the user."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Existing Accessibility Tags (Priority: P1)

Users upload a PDF and want to understand what accessibility features already exist in the document before making changes. They need to see a clear inventory of existing tags, alternative text, reading order information, and structure elements.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational for the entire application. Users cannot make informed decisions about accessibility improvements without first understanding the current state of their PDF. This serves as the diagnostic step before any remediation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a PDF with known accessibility features and verifying that the extracted information accurately reflects those features. Delivers immediate value by showing users their PDF's accessibility status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PDF with alt text on images, **When** user uploads the file, **Then** the system displays all images with their associated alt text descriptions
2. **Given** a PDF with document structure tags (headings, paragraphs, lists), **When** user views the accessibility information, **Then** the system shows the document's structural hierarchy
3. **Given** a PDF with no accessibility features, **When** user uploads the file, **Then** the system clearly indicates which accessibility features are missing
4. **Given** a PDF with reading order information, **When** user views accessibility details, **Then** the system displays the logical reading order of content elements
5. **Given** an encrypted or password-protected PDF, **When** user uploads the file, **Then** the system rejects it with an error message instructing the user to decrypt the file first

### User Story 2 - Understand Missing Accessibility Features (Priority: P2)

Users need guidance on what accessibility information is absent from their PDF so they can prioritize remediation efforts.

**Why this priority**: After seeing existing features (P1), users need to understand gaps. This informs their next steps and helps them plan accessibility improvements.

**Independent Test**: Upload a PDF with partial accessibility features and verify that the system correctly identifies and categorizes missing elements (e.g., "10 images without alt text", "No document structure tags").

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PDF with images but no alt text, **When** user views the report, **Then** the system identifies and counts images missing alt text
2. **Given** a PDF without structure tags, **When** user views the report, **Then** the system indicates that document structure is not defined
3. **Given** a PDF with mixed accessibility (some features present, others missing), **When** user views the report, **Then** the system provides a summary showing both present and missing features
4. **Given** extraction results are displayed, **When** user views in simple mode, **Then** the system shows high-level summaries (e.g., "5 images, 3 with alt text")
5. **Given** extraction results are displayed, **When** user toggles to detailed view, **Then** the system shows technical breakdown of each accessibility element with full attributes

---

### Edge Cases

- Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected with an error message instructing users to decrypt the file before upload
- Corrupted or malformed accessibility tags are reported as errors; extraction continues for valid portions of the document
- Non-standard or proprietary accessibility markup is ignored; only standard PDF 1.7 accessibility features are extracted
- Very large PDFs that exceed 10-second extraction timeout are aborted with an error message informing users the file is too complex for synchronous processing
- Empty or invalid accessibility metadata is treated as "feature not present" rather than causing extraction failure

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract image objects from PDF and identify whether alt text is present for each image
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract document structure tags (if present) including headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify reading order information from the PDF's structure tree
- **FR-004**: System MUST present extracted accessibility information in a user-friendly web interface with two viewing modes: a simplified summary view (default) and a detailed technical view (togglable)
- **FR-005**: System MUST distinguish between PDFs with no accessibility features and those with partial accessibility features
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate PDF file structure before processing and report validity errors to users
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle PDFs that fail to parse gracefully, providing clear error messages to users
- **FR-008**: System MUST emit warnings to users when processing unusually large PDFs (no hard size limit imposed)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display the extraction results on a dedicated page after PDF upload
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to view accessibility information for the uploaded PDF without modifying the original file
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify language metadata and document title from accessibility information
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain uploaded PDFs and extraction results for 1 hour in-memory cache with automatic cleanup
- **FR-013**: System architecture MUST support future migration to session-based retention without requiring major refactoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST detect encrypted PDFs during validation and reject them with a clear error message instructing users to decrypt the file before uploading
- **FR-015**: System MUST abort extraction operations that exceed 10 seconds and present an error message to users
- **FR-016**: System architecture MUST support future migration to asynchronous background processing with progress indicators
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a toggle mechanism allowing users to switch between simplified summary and detailed technical views of extraction results

### Assumptions

- Extraction will focus on the most common PDF accessibility features (alt text, structure tags, reading order) rather than attempting comprehensive PDF/UA validation
- Initial MVP will handle standard PDF accessibility markup as defined in PDF 1.7 specification
- Performance target assumes PDFs of typical business document size (1-50 pages, under 10MB)
- Extraction library will be designed as a separate component that can be tested independently of the Django views
- MVP uses in-memory cache for 1-hour retention; architecture must accommodate future migration to session-based persistence with disk storage for large files
- MVP uses synchronous extraction with 10-second timeout; architecture must accommodate future migration to asynchronous background processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **PDF Document**: The uploaded file being analyzed; attributes include filename, file size, page count, temporary storage identifier, and retention expiry timestamp (1 hour from upload)
- **Accessibility Feature**: An individual accessibility element found in the PDF; attributes include type (alt text, structure tag, reading order), status (present/missing), associated content reference
- **Extraction Result**: The complete analysis output for a PDF; includes lists of found features, missing features, and any errors encountered during extraction
- **Image Reference**: A specific image object in the PDF; attributes include position (page number, coordinates), dimensions, and alt text value (if present)
- **Structure Element**: A tagged structure element from the PDF's structure tree; attributes include type (heading level, paragraph, list item), content, and hierarchical position

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: When users upload PDF files, how should the system validate and protect against malicious or oversized files? → A: No size limit, but emit warnings to users. Check PDF validity and report errors to the user.
- Q: How long should uploaded PDF files and their extraction results be retained in the system? → A: 1 hour in-memory cache for MVP, but design to support session-based retention with disk storage for future long-lived editing sessions.
- Q: How should the system handle encrypted or password-protected PDFs? → A: Reject encrypted PDFs with error message directing users to decrypt first.
- Q: When extraction exceeds the 10-second performance target (e.g., for very large PDFs), what should happen? → A: Abort at 10 seconds with error message for MVP; design to support background processing with progress indicator in future.
- Q: For the extraction results display, should the interface show raw technical details or simplified summaries? → A: Show two views - simple summary by default, detailed view available via toggle.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can upload a PDF and view extracted accessibility information within 10 seconds for typical documents (under 5MB, 1-20 pages); extraction aborts with clear error message if timeout is exceeded
- **SC-002**: System correctly identifies at least 95% of images with alt text in standard-compliant PDFs
- **SC-003**: System correctly identifies document structure tags when present in standard-compliant PDFs with 95% accuracy
- **SC-004**: Users can distinguish between PDFs with no accessibility features, partial features, and comprehensive features based on the display
- **SC-005**: 90% of users can understand the accessibility status of their PDF after viewing the simplified summary view (measured through user testing or feedback)
- **SC-006**: System handles PDF parsing errors gracefully, showing helpful error messages in 100% of error cases rather than crashing
