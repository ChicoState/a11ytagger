# Specification Quality Checklist: PDF Accessibility Information Extraction & Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All items passed** ✅

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of Django, pikepdf, or specific technologies)
- ✅ Focus is on user outcomes (viewing, understanding accessibility status)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No clarification markers present - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by checking if images and alt text are extracted)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentage, accuracy)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., SC-001 uses user-facing time limit, not technical metrics)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format and are concrete
- ✅ Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (encryption, corruption, large files)
- ✅ Scope is bounded to extraction and display (MVP approach, not full PDF/UA validation)
- ✅ Assumptions section clearly identifies what is in/out of scope

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ User Story 1 (P1) provides standalone MVP value
- ✅ User Story 2 (P2) builds on P1 but is independently testable
- ✅ Each story has clear acceptance criteria mapping to functional requirements
- ✅ Success criteria provide measurable definition of "done"

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`. No issues found.

The specification successfully:
- Defines a clear MVP scope (extraction and display only)
- Provides measurable success criteria
- Identifies two independently deliverable user stories
- Acknowledges that pikepdf lacks built-in a11y extraction support
- Sets realistic performance expectations
- Avoids premature technical decisions while being specific about user needs
